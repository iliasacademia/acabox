# Cite Action

Citation and reference assistance. Used directly when the user asks about citations, and invoked as a sub-process by other actions (Draft, Revise, Feedback, Review) when they need to bring in outside knowledge.

## Two Modes

**User-facing:** The user explicitly asks about citations ("where do I need citations?", "find me a reference for this claim", "is this cited correctly?").

**Sub-process:** Another action identifies a claim that needs a reference and routes through Cite for verification before presenting it to the user.

## Verification Process

When a reference is needed, follow this priority order:

1. **Check the author's Zotero library first** (see "Using Zotero" below). If the relevant paper is already in the author's collection, use it. This is the highest-confidence source.
2. **Check local workspace references** (see "Using Local References" below). Papers the user has collected in their workspace are higher-confidence than external search.
3. **Otherwise, use the CiteRight tools to find verified references** (see "Using CiteRight" below).
4. **Always label the source.** The user must know whether a reference came from their own library, their workspace, or from CiteRight's external search. Tag visibly: *from your Zotero library*, *from your workspace*, or *from CiteRight*. This rule applies to every reference shown, regardless of source — do not omit the tag.

## Using Zotero

The author's local Zotero library is the highest-confidence source: anything there is something the author has already curated. Two tools are available:

- `mcp__zotero__status` — no params. Returns `{status: "running"}` when the local Zotero desktop client is reachable.
- `mcp__zotero__search_library` — `query` (string, required, non-empty) and optional `limit` (default 10). Returns an array of items.

### Status-first pattern

Call `mcp__zotero__status` first. If the response is not `{status: "running"}`, skip Zotero silently and fall through to CiteRight. Zotero requires the desktop client running on the user's machine — its absence is normal, not a failure. **Do not surface this as a blocker to the user.**

### Query strategy

`limit` is silently capped near 10 regardless of what you pass, and the search is keyword/lexical (not semantic). A single broad query will not enumerate the relevant subset of the library. Compensate by issuing several targeted queries built from the claim — significant nouns, author surnames if the claim names anyone, and topic words — then union the results and dedupe by the `key` field. Be generous with variants since conceptually related papers won't surface unless they share words with the claim.

### itemType filter

The library contains noise: stray webpage saves (e.g. a Google sign-in page saved as `itemType: webpage`), bare PDF attachments without metadata. Keep only citation-grade types:

- `journalArticle`, `preprint`, `book`, `bookSection`, `conferencePaper`, `thesis`

Drop `webpage` and `attachment` results.

### Verification

A keyword hit is not a verified match. After filtering, read each candidate's `title` and `abstractNote` against the claim. Only present a match you are confident actually supports the claim. If nothing in the filtered set clearly supports the claim, fall through to CiteRight — do not present a weak Zotero hit as if verified. Apply the same meaning check as for CiteRight results: topic overlap is not enough — the paper must support the specific number, mechanism, or comparison in the claim.

### Field mapping (Zotero → citation fields)

- `title` → title
- `creators[]` filtered to `creatorType == "author"`, lastName + firstName → authors
- `date` → publication_year (parse the year prefix; e.g. `"2024-05-03"` → 2024, `"06/2015"` → 2015, `"2026-03"` → 2026)
- `publicationTitle` → journal / publication
- `DOI` → doi; build the link as `https://doi.org/<DOI>`
- `url` → fallback link when DOI is absent
- `abstractNote` → use to verify the paper supports the claim (do not present as part of the citation)

### Presenting Zotero results

Use the same per-publication format as CiteRight results so the user sees a consistent layout. For each verified Zotero match show:

- **Full title**.
- **Authors** — list them; "First Author et al." with the count is fine for long lists.
- **Year** and **journal/publication**.
- **A clickable link** — markdown `[DOI](https://doi.org/<DOI>)` when DOI is present, otherwise the `url` field, otherwise "no link available" (do not drop the entry).
- **Why this matches** — a short sentence in your own words explaining why the paper supports the claim. Zotero does not provide a `reasoning` field, so write it from the `title` and `abstractNote`. Keep it as concise as CiteRight's `reasoning`.

**Example** (matches the CiteRight format):

> **Cao, Short & Yip (2017)** — "Understanding the mechanisms of amorphous creep through molecular simulation," *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*. [10.1073/pnas.1708618114](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1708618114) — *from your Zotero library*
> *Why matched:* The abstract identifies the microscopic processes of creep as an open question, supporting the claim that these origins are poorly understood compared to crystalline solids.

### Formatting Zotero items into a citation style

Zotero results map cleanly into `mcp__citeright__format_citations`. Pass an array of works built from the field mapping above (`title`, `authors`, `publication_year`, `publication`, `doi`) to format Zotero-sourced references in MLA, APA, Chicago, Vancouver, Harvard, IEEE, or ACS.

## Using Local References

The user's workspace may contain reference PDFs that have been scanned and converted to readable markdown. These are papers the user has collected — higher confidence than external search, lower than a curated Zotero library.

### Discovery

Call `mcp__workspace__get_scanned_files` with `file_type` set to `"reference"`. The response contains an array of files:

Only entries with a `markdown_path` field have been converted to readable text. Skip entries without it.

### Shortlisting and reading

The title of each reference is embedded in the `markdown_path` filename. Scan these titles against the claim and shortlist any that could plausibly be relevant — be generous, since titles are abbreviated. When in doubt, include it.

**You must `Read` at least the shortlisted files** — do not skip local references and jump straight to CiteRight. For each shortlisted file, use the `Read` tool on the `markdown_path`. The file has YAML frontmatter (`source`, `title`) followed by the full extracted text. Verify the text content against the claim using the same meaning check as Zotero and CiteRight — the paper must support the specific claim, not just share the general topic.

If the workspace has fewer than ~10 references, read all of them rather than shortlisting by title alone.

### Presenting local reference results

Use the same per-publication format as Zotero and CiteRight results. For each verified match show:

- **Full title** from the frontmatter.
- **Authors and year** — extract from the text if possible (look at the first page content). If not extractable, omit rather than guess.
- **Source file** — show the original `file_path` (e.g. `refs/paper.pdf`) so the user knows which file it came from.
- **Why this matches** — a short sentence explaining why the paper supports the claim, written from the extracted text.

### Fallthrough

If no local reference passes the meaning check, fall through to CiteRight silently — same pattern as Zotero.

## Using CiteRight

CiteRight runs vector + web search over published literature, ranks candidates with an LLM, and verifies them -- so anything it returns is real, not fabricated.

**Choosing the input.** Before any CiteRight call:

1. If `mcp__ms-word__get_selection` is available (Word session), call it. If it returns non-empty text, that's the input -- the user highlighted a passage and wants references for that passage, not the whole paper. Use the **short input path** below.
2. If the selection is empty, the user wants references for the whole document. Call `mcp__ms-word__get_file_path`. If it returns a `.docx` or `.pdf` path, that's the input. Use the **long input path** below.
3. If no file path is available (unsaved document), fall back to `mcp__ms-word__get_text` and treat that text as a long input.
4. If ms-word tools are not available (non-Word session), use the user's message text or the claim text as the input. Use the **short input path** below.

### Short input path (selections, single claims)

- Call `mcp__citeright__find_references` with `document_text` set to the selection. The tool blocks until the backend reports `done: true`, then returns the slim report. Selections are fast -- usually finishes in well under a minute.
- Read each claim's `top_publications` and present title, authors, year, DOI/URL, and the `reasoning` field that explains why CiteRight matched it.

### Long input path (whole document, file upload, large text)

These can take 5-10 minutes. **Do not call `find_references` here** -- it would block silently for the entire wait and the user won't see progress. Instead, drive the polling loop yourself so progress is visible:

1. Kick off the report: `mcp__citeright__create_citation_report` with `document_text`, OR upload a file via `find_references` with `file_path` and a low `timeout_seconds` (e.g. 5) so it returns the `report_id` quickly without blocking.
2. Tell the user the report is in flight ("Submitted to CiteRight, report id N, fetching results as they come in...").
3. Loop: call `mcp__citeright__get_citation_report` with the `report_id`. Between calls, briefly summarize what's new -- e.g. "Claim 1 has 5 references so far; claim 2 still searching." Wait roughly 20-30 seconds between polls. Do not poll faster than every ~10 seconds.
4. Stop polling when `report.done` is `true`. Then present the full set of references organized by claim, same as the short path.
5. If the user asks you to stop, stop. The report stays available -- they can ask later and you can resume polling with the same `report_id`.

**Important constraints for both paths:**

- `top_publications` are CiteRight's *new* citation suggestions for the claim. This is distinct from the paper's existing reference list -- do not confuse the two.
- Never present partial state as final. While `report.done` is `false`, label results as "so far" and keep polling.
- Never fall back to LLM-fabricated references when CiteRight is still running or returns nothing useful.

**Presenting references — show every detail, every reference, every claim.** The user needs the full picture to decide which references to use, so do not compress the response into a terse summary. The full report is what we asked for; surface it.

For **each claim** in the report, show:

- The claim text (as a heading or bold lead-in).
- **Every** publication in `top_publications` for that claim — do not pick just two or three "highlights". The user wants to see the ranked set CiteRight returned.
- The claim's `search_status` if it's anything other than complete (e.g. `"timed_out"`, `"died"`, `"unstarted"`) — say so explicitly so the user knows that claim's results are partial or missing.

For **each publication**, show all of these:

- **Full title** (not abbreviated).
- **Authors** — list them; for long lists, "First Author et al." is acceptable but include the count.
- **Year** and **journal/publication**.
- **A clickable link.** Use the publication's `link_url` field directly — it's already a `https://doi.org/...` URL the chat UI can open. If `link_url` is absent (no DOI on this work), say "no DOI available" rather than dropping the entry. Do not use the raw `url` or `doi` fields to build your own link — `link_url` is the only one guaranteed to pass the renderer's whitelist.
- **Reasoning**: the `reasoning` field explains *why* CiteRight matched this paper to the claim. This is one of the most useful parts of the response — always include it.
- **Optional metadata** — surface these inline when present (often they're undefined; skip silently when so):
  - `impact_factor` — journal impact factor. Useful credibility signal: e.g. "*Nature*, IF 50.5".
  - `relevance_score` — CiteRight's 0–1 confidence in this match. Mention only when it's notably low (< 0.5) or when the user is comparing candidates.
  - `cited_by_count` — total citation count. Worth showing when high (≥ 100) as an established-paper signal.
  - `is_oa` — open-access flag. If `true`, mention "open access" so the user knows they can read it without a paywall.
  - `pdf_url` — direct PDF link when available. Format as a separate `[PDF](pdf_url)` link alongside the DOI link.

After listing references, if `report.public_token` is present, mention once at the end that the user can view the full interactive report on academia.edu (the report is browseable there; the chat shows the agent's selection). Don't try to construct a URL — just mention the report can be opened on academia.edu via the report id `<report_id>` and public token `<public_token>` if asked.

Format the link in markdown so the chat UI renders it as clickable: `[link text](link_url)`. The link text should be the DOI string, the journal name, or "DOI" — short and recognizable.

**Good example** (one publication, fully expanded):

> **Cao, Short & Yip (2017)** — "Understanding the mechanisms of amorphous creep through molecular simulation," *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*. [10.1073/pnas.1708618114](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1708618114)
> *Why matched:* Explicitly identifies the microscopic processes of creep as a "standing challenge" and an "open question," supporting the claim that these origins are poorly understood compared to crystalline solids.

The chat UI opens links in the system's default browser, so a fully formatted reference becomes a one-click verification path for the user.

**Ignore CiteRight backend strings that reference UI controls.** Fields like `message_to_user` sometimes say "click highlighted claims" or "explore the full list" — those target the CiteRight web app, not this chat. End your response with a concrete next-step offer ("Want me to insert any of these as citations?", "Want me to format these in APA?") instead of telling the user to click something that doesn't exist.

**To add a specific manual claim to a report** (when the user gives you an exact sentence to cite):

- Call `mcp__citeright__add_claim_to_report` with the report id and the claim text. It returns the updated report including the new `claim_id`.
- Then call `mcp__citeright__search_citations_for_claim` with the report id and that `claim_id` to get ranked publications back for it specifically.

**To format a list of works into a specific citation style:**

- Call `mcp__citeright__format_citations` with an array of works (each needs at minimum a `title`; richer fields like `authors`, `doi`, `publication_year`, `publication`, `volume`, `issue`, `pages` produce better output). Up to 50 works per call.
- Available formats: MLA, APA, Chicago, Vancouver, Harvard, IEEE, ACS. The response returns each format keyed by name.

**To resume work on a prior report:**

- Call `mcp__citeright__list_citation_reports` to see the user's recent reports, then `mcp__citeright__get_citation_report` for the one you want.

### Login requirement

CiteRight requires a logged-in academia.edu account. If a tool returns an error containing "requires a logged-in academia.edu account", surface that to the user verbatim and stop -- do not fall back to unverified LLM-suggested references for that turn.

### Meaning check

Topic overlap is not a valid match. Before presenting any reference to the user, verify that the source supports the specific claim it is being attached to.

For each candidate publication CiteRight returns, ask:

- Does this source support the **exact wording** of the claim — the specific number, mechanism, conclusion, or comparison — or does it only share the general subject area?
- If the claim contains a **specific value** (a percentage, a count, a p-value, a named effect), does that value appear in or follow directly from this source?
- If the claim makes a **comparative statement** ("more effective than", "higher than", "first to show"), does this source make or directly support that comparison?

If the answer to the relevant question is no, the candidate fails the meaning check. Do not present it as a valid citation.

When a candidate passes topic match but fails meaning check, do not silently discard it. Tell the user:

> "CiteRight found [title] ([year]) for this claim, but it covers [general topic] rather than [the specific claim]. I have not included it."

If no candidate passes the meaning check, treat the claim as unverified and mark it [citation needed — no verified match for this specific claim], the same as when CiteRight returns nothing at all.

### When CiteRight returns nothing useful

If the ranked publications don't fit the claim, say so plainly. Do not pad the answer with unverified LLM guesses. It is better to say "CiteRight didn't surface a strong match for this claim -- you may need to search manually" than to present a low-confidence reference as if verified.

## Common Knowledge Check

If a domain profile is available, consult it to determine whether a claim is common knowledge in this subfield (no citation needed) or requires a reference. Otherwise, err on the side of citing.

## Constraints

- Never fabricate citation details (authors, titles, journals, years, DOIs)
- Never present an LLM-suggested reference as if it were verified -- always route through CiteRight or the author's materials first
- When multiple references could support a claim, prefer the one already in the author's materials (Zotero or workspace) over a CiteRight result
