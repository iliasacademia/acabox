/**
 * Importing a skill from GitHub.
 *
 * One HTTPS request fetches a repository tarball from `codeload.github.com`;
 * `/usr/bin/tar` extracts the one subdirectory we want. No git, no auth, no
 * clone, no registry client. Everything below was measured against the real
 * endpoints while writing it, and the measurements are recorded inline because
 * several of them contradict what the obvious implementation would assume.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE OTHER THREE OPTIONS
 * -------------------------------
 * - **git.** `/usr/bin/git` on macOS is a 118 KB Command Line Tools *shim* that
 *   fails outright without Xcode CLT installed. `/usr/bin/tar` is a real
 *   275 KB Mach-O bsdtar (libarchive 3.7.4, confirmed on this machine), so it
 *   is the only extractor safe to depend on. The CLI's own `/plugin install`
 *   resolves subdirectories with git sparse-checkout, which is exactly why we
 *   cannot reuse it.
 * - **`api.github.com` for content.** 60 requests/hour unauthenticated
 *   (measured: `x-ratelimit-limit: 60`), and its contents API returns
 *   `content: null` for directories, one level deep. Reserved here strictly
 *   for metadata: resolving a ref to a commit SHA, and the update check.
 * - **`raw.githubusercontent.com`.** Sends `cache-control: max-age=300` even
 *   on SHA-pinned, immutable URLs. A five-minute stale window on bytes we are
 *   about to hash into a provenance record is not acceptable.
 *
 * WHAT WAS MEASURED, AND WHAT IT COSTS US
 * ---------------------------------------
 * 1. **codeload sends no `content-length`** — the response is chunked, and the
 *    only headers are `etag`, `content-type: application/x-gzip` and
 *    `content-disposition`. So download progress can report *bytes received*
 *    and nothing else. It must NOT report a percentage: there is no
 *    denominator, and inventing one is exactly the fabricated-status rule this
 *    codebase already wrote down. (This is the one way the download here is
 *    unlike `selfUpdater.downloadWithProgress`, whose size comes from a signed
 *    manifest. The streaming/backpressure/throttle shape is copied from it.)
 * 2. **codeload returns no rate-limit headers at all.** Tarball fetches are
 *    free; the 60/hr budget is spent only by `resolveRef` and
 *    `checkForUpdate`. Neither may ever run on a timer.
 * 3. **bsdtar refuses `..` traversal but happily materialises symlinks** —
 *    both absolute (`link-out -> /etc/passwd`) and escaping-relative
 *    (`nested/rel-out -> ../../../../../../etc/hosts`). Both were extracted
 *    and dereferenced successfully while writing this. Acabox's symlink reaper
 *    (`containerService.syncWorkspaceSymlinks`) only inspects workspace-ROOT
 *    entries, so a link nested inside `.claude/skills/<id>/` survives every
 *    boot forever. `stripSymlinks` is therefore not hygiene, it is the
 *    mitigation for a real hole. It runs before anything else looks at the
 *    tree.
 * 4. **A git blob SHA is locally recomputable**: `sha1("blob <len>\0" + bytes)`
 *    reproduced `d3e046a5ae107a6cb23cfb16c219837094ab35d3` byte-identically
 *    for `anthropics/skills@b29e7cf:skills/pdf/SKILL.md` against the tree API.
 *    That is what makes the update check *per file* and one API call: we can
 *    fill `upstreamBlobs` at import time from the archive bytes with zero
 *    extra requests, then diff a single tree listing against it later.
 *
 * INTEGRITY MODEL, STATED PLAINLY
 * -------------------------------
 * There is no signed manifest for a skill and there cannot be one. Integrity
 * rests on TLS plus the 40-character commit SHA — which makes an import
 * reproducible and auditable, and does not make it safe. An imported
 * `SKILL.md` is instructions the model will follow, and a bundled script runs
 * with the user's full privileges the moment Claude invokes it, because Bash
 * is auto-approved in this app with no permission handler. Hence `execCount` /
 * `execPaths`: the caller is expected to state them before committing.

 *   ships built-ins with all four names. **That** is the collision.
 * - `openai/plugins` ships none of the four. Its 581 browsable skills collide
 *   with nothing Acabox ships — the design doc's §7 prerequisite attributes
 *   the document-skill collision to the wrong repository.
 * - `openai/plugins` does collide with ITSELF: six ids appear twice
 *   (`react-best-practices`, `stripe-best-practices`, `cli`, `agents-sdk`,
 *   `setup`, `chronograph-portfolio-company-one-pager`). Importing both
 *   copies of one hits this function on the second, which is why the check is
 *   against the store's ids rather than against a builtin list.
 *
 * The three available policies and why this one:
 *
 * - *Suffix automatically.* The id is what the model types into
 *   `Skill({skill})` and what the skill's own prose refers to; changing it
 *   without saying so produces a skill whose body describes a name that does
 *   not exist.
 * - *Replace the built-in.* Destroys the user's built-in silently on a button
 *   labelled "Import", and the store's revert path would then have two
 *   pristine sources for one id.
 * - *Refuse outright.* Correct but useless — `anthropics/skills`'s `pdf` may
 *   genuinely be the one the user wants.
 *
 * So: surface it. The suggestion is `<id>-<owner>` (`pdf-anthropics`), which
 * is both free and self-explanatory, falling back to a numeric suffix.
