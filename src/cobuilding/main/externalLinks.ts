/**
 * Every link surfaced anywhere in Acabox opens in the user's default browser.
 *
 * These guards are installed on *every* WebContents the app creates, which
 * makes them the single chokepoint: chat Markdown links, hyperlinks in an
 * .xlsx cell, `<a>` tags inside a mini-app iframe, `window.open`, and any
 * link-rendering code written later all funnel through here without needing
 * their own `onClick` handler.
 *
 * Without them there are two failure modes, both live before this existed:
 *
 *   - A plain `<a href="https://…">` navigates the top-level renderer away
 *     from the app. Acabox draws its own chrome and has no address bar or
 *     back button, so the window is simply stuck on the remote page.
 *   - `target="_blank"` / `window.open` makes Electron spawn a bare
 *     BrowserWindow that inherits our `webPreferences` and preload — remote
 *     content next to the app's IPC surface, with no UI to close it.
 *
 * Chat links additionally go through `AnchorWithDoi`, which calls the
 * `open-external-url` IPC on click; that runs first and this never fires for
 * them. It is kept as the net for every other surface.
 *
 * One surface cannot be handled here at all — links inside a mini-app frame,
 * which the host CSP refuses before any navigation event fires. Those are
 * covered by the script in `miniAppLinkShim.ts`, injected below.
